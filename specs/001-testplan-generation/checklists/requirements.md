# Specification Quality Checklist: Test Plan Generation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-01-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Result**: ✅ All validation criteria passed

### Key Strengths:
- Comprehensive user scenarios with clear prioritization (P1-P3)
- Well-defined functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-020)
- Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Clear scope boundaries with detailed Out of Scope section
- Thorough edge case identification
- Complete assumptions and dependencies sections

### Notes:
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All requirements are implementation-agnostic and focused on user value
- No clarification questions needed - all requirements are unambiguous
