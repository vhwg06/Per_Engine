# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Specification-Driven Development**:
- [ ] Feature defined through explicit, machine-readable specification
- [ ] Specification version-controlled and precedes implementation

**Domain-Driven Design**:
- [ ] Domain models independent of infrastructure (databases, execution engines, file formats)
- [ ] Core logic expressed in ubiquitous language without technical coupling
- [ ] If persistence required: repositories implement domain-defined abstractions

**Clean Architecture**:
- [ ] Dependencies point inward (domain ← application ← adapters ← infrastructure)
- [ ] External systems accessed only through domain-defined interfaces
- [ ] No infrastructure imports in domain/application layers

**Layered Phase Independence**:
- [ ] Clear phase boundaries (specification → generation → execution → analysis → persistence → reporting)
- [ ] Phases communicate through serializable, engine-agnostic interfaces
- [ ] Changes isolated to single phase without cascading coupling

**Determinism & Reproducibility**:
- [ ] Identical specifications produce identical artifacts
- [ ] Non-deterministic factors (timestamps, randomness) controlled or normalized
- [ ] All inputs, configurations, and criteria explicitly versioned

**Engine-Agnostic Abstraction** (if execution engine involved):
- [ ] Results normalized into engine-agnostic domain models
- [ ] Evaluation logic operates on domain models, not engine-specific formats
- [ ] No engine data structures or APIs leak into domain layer

**Evolution-Friendly Design**:
- [ ] No technology locked at constitutional level (specific languages/frameworks/databases are plan-level decisions)
- [ ] New capabilities extend existing layers without bypassing architecture
- [ ] Breaking changes explicitly justified and documented

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
